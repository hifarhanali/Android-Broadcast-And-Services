# Android Broadcast Receivers and Services

This android project contains examples of some broadcast receivers i.e receivers for Bluetooth, incoming calls, airplane mode, and battery monitoring. Moreover,  I have implemented a music service that runs in the background when a user clicks on the start button on the home page.

## Broadcast Receivers
1) Bluetooth: Toast messgae whenever the user switch on/off the bluetooth.
2) Incoming Calls: Display number of the incoming call and status of incoming call i.e ringing, ended, etc.
3) Airplone Mode: Trigger on change in airplane mode activeness i.e ON, OFF.
4) Battery: Whenever a user plug in the mobile, it will be triggered.

## Services
Music: Starts in the background when a user clicks on the start button on the homepage. Stop when a user returns back to the homepage.
